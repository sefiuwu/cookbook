\section{Shawarma}

\begin{ingredients}
	\item 300g flour
	\item 200g warm water
	\item 1tsp sugar
	\item 1tsp salt
	\item 1tsp yeast
\end{ingredients}

\subsection{Instructions:}
\begin{enumerate}
	\item Mix the water, sugar and yeast in a bowl. Let it rest in a warm place while the yeast blooms for approximately 10m.
	\item Mix the flour and salt into the bowl. Once it becomes manageable, knead the dough for approximately 5 minutes, or until smooth and elastic. Let it rest for at least one hour. Keep warm, if possible.
	\item Take dough out and cut into 6 equal parts. Form into balls and let them rest 10 minutes for the second leavening.
	\item Begin heating a pan at high heat. While it heats, begin flattening the first ball of dough. Aim for disks of 20cm diameter.
	\item Wait until one side is starting to get burnt spots, then flip. You can use the cooking time to start flattetning the rest of the disks. Once both sides are cooked, remove it from the pan and set it aside. Repeat this step for each ball.
\end{enumerate}
